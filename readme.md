# Webserver for my portfolio
This is the webserver that I am currently using to serve my statically generated site, [found here](https://github.com/FadedStatic/fadedstatic.tech).<br/>
It uses Actix-Web, a web framework written in Rust. I chose this as it enables me to make the most of my nanode instance (1GB RAM 1vCPU) due to it being lightweight, and blazingly fast.<br/>

# License
Feel free to use this software however you like, this also serves as a learning resource.
